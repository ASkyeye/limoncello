# Limoncello

> Yet another LLVM-based obfuscation pipeline.

**This is an incomplete project from 2023.** I've decided to release it almost
a year later as I have not worked on it in months, and others might find the
source interesting or helpful to browse. Feel free to reach out if you have any
questions about how it works, but support, etc. will not be provided and I
don't have any intent to continue working on this project publicly.
